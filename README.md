# Dileepkumar-gopalapalli-DataAnalyst-Internship
Welcome to my Data Analyst Internship Portfolio.

This repository represents my complete end-to-end analytics journey — from raw data cleaning to statistical validation and executive-level business storytelling.

Throughout this internship, I worked on progressively structured phases designed to simulate real-world analytics workflows and stakeholder reporting.

This portfolio demonstrates not only technical skills, but also business thinking and statistical rigor.

🎯 Internship Objective

To apply data analysis techniques, visualization, and statistical methods to extract actionable business insights from real-world retail data.

The internship was structured into four progressive phases:

Data Cleaning & Exploration

Data Visualization & Insight Generation

Business Storytelling & Strategic Recommendations

Statistical Validation Using Hypothesis Testing

📂 Project Structure
🔹 Part 1 – Data Cleaning & Exploration

Objective: Prepare raw retail transaction data for analysis.

Key Activities:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

🔹 Part 4 – Statistical Validation & Hypothesis Testing

Objective: Validate business insights using inferential statistics.

Business Question:

Do UK customers purchase significantly different quantities compared to Non-UK customers?

Statistical Approach:

Independent Sample T-Test (Welch’s T-Test)

Significance Level (α = 0.05)

Key Results:

UK Mean Quantity: 8.61

Non-UK Mean Quantity: 19.66

T-Statistic: -28.29

P-Value: 8.21 × 10⁻¹⁷⁶

Conclusion:

There is a statistically significant difference in purchasing behavior between UK and international customers.

This insight directly impacts:

Inventory planning

Regional marketing strategies

International expansion decisions
